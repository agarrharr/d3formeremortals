title: What is d3?

D3 stands for Data Driven Documents, which basically just means that d3 is good for making data visualizations. It's written in JavaScript, so that means it's good for making **data visualizations for the web**. And since it's on the web, those visualizations can be **interactive**, meaning you can click around on them and manipulate them. And they can be **dynamic**, meaning that the data can come from anywhere and the data can change.

And that's basically the entire purpose of d3. But it doesn't just give you a few charts that you can build and customize. In fact, it doesn't give you any charts at all. D3 just gives you the tools to build your own charts, graphs, and pretty much any kind of visualization that you can dream up.

Everything that is a part of d3 is there to make the job of creating visualizations easier. This includes everything from:

* DOM selections
* DOM manipulations
* SVG utilities
* Geography
* Geometry
* Scales- various ways of mapping input to output
* Time functions
* Data manipulation
* Loading data
* Formating strings
* Transitions
* Layouts for common visualizations
* Dragging and Zooming
* Events
* And much much more...

So you can see how d3 can be overwhelming, but it's ok, you don't have to learn everything and you can take it one step at a time.
