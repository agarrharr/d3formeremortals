title: What is d3?
---

D3 stands for Data Driven Documents, which basically just means that d3 is good for making data visualizations. It's written in JavaScript, so that means it's good for making **data visualizations for the web**. And since it's on the web, those visualizations can be **interactive**, meaning you can click around on them and manipulate them. And they can be **dynamic**, meaning that the data can come from anywhere and the data can change.

And that's basically the entire purpose of d3. But it doesn't just give you a few charts that you can build and customize. In fact, it doesn't give you any charts at all. D3 just gives you the tools to build your own charts, graphs, and pretty much any kind of visualization that you can dream up.
