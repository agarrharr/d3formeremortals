title: Why I created this site

When I accepted my current job, created data visualizations using d3, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I had never heard of d3, much less created the kinds of amazing charts that I would be expected to create.

D3 was unlike anything I had ever used and it was hard to wrap my head around. It seemed like d3 was some sort of crazy magic and that a mere mortal like myself couldn't learn to control it.

Long story short, I didn't feel like there were enough great resources out there when I was first learning. So I thought I would make a site with some easy to follow explanations, tutorials, example code, and d3 news.

I hope you enjoy it.
