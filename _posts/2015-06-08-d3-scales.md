Scales are a really important and powerful aspect of D3.js. They were also a source of confusion to me when I first started learning D3. A scale is not the same thing as an axis. A scale is really just a function that takes an input and turns it into a certain output. And this is something you need to do all the time with D3, so undertanding them well, and knowing what all your options are is really important. For instance, you might need to turn a data value into a position in the x direction. For example, you might have the data `[1, 2, 4, 6.5]` and want to show that on your x-scale between 0-650px, like so.

The naive approach would be to create your own function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function scale(d) {
  return d * 100;
}
{% endhighlight %}
