What are the best resources for learning d3? It may be hard to know where to start, so here are a few good resources:

* [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web by Scott Murray](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html)

   This is a great book that is even easy for beginners to follow. If you're more advanced, you can skip the first 4 chapters, although you might want to read the part about SVG in chapter 3. Chapter 1 is an introduction to visualizations, chapter 2 is an introduction to d3, chapter 3 is an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG, and then chapter 4 is how to get set up.

* [The D3 Wiki](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki)

   The wiki contains information about every part of d3, and it can be a bit overwhelming to navigate, and to understand. The search box on the right will only search by page name, so I recommend going to the [API Reference](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference), which references the entire API and using Find (Ctrl-f or Cmd-f) to search for functions.

* [Examples by Mike Bostockk](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)

   Mike Bostock's has an enormous amount of d3 examples. Mike Bostock is the main developer of d3 and he is constantly putting up new examples of interesting things you can do with d3.

* [bl.ocksplorer.org](http://bl.ocksplorer.org/)

   Blocksplorer is a site where you can search bl.ocks.org examples based on specific d3 functions. This is a great way to find examples of a specific function that you may not understand how to use or what it's useful for.

* [Course on D3.js on teamtreehouse.com](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/d3js)

   I haven't tried this course in particular, but I know that team treehouse is a great site for learning coding. It's a very engaging and fun site.

* [Course on D3.js on lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/D3js-tutorials/Data-Visualization-D3js/162449-2.html)

   Lynda.com is similar to teamtreehouse.com except that it doesn't have quizes or online challenges, but this means that you can skip around and watch the videos that interest you. They also provide code examples that you can download if you want to follow along.
