title: D3 For Mere Mortals

I learned d3, the way that I've learned most things that I've learned on my own. Learn just enough to get myself in trouble and then start building stuff. And then I ended up hating myself 6 months later, when I knew more of what I was doing.

Of course, I didn't learn d3 on my own. I was lucky enough to have a whole team of co-workers that I could turn to when I was stuck. And there are a ton of examples on the Internet.

I've been using d3 for over a year, and I'm still learning new things you can do with it and things that are best practices.

On this site, I will be posting things that I've learned along the way, and things that I'm still learning. I hope someone finds it useful.
